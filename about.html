                        have migrated from countries, like Afghanistan, to make them feel powerful and to give a space

                    </div>
                    <p>In late 2019, the seeds of The Secret Vault were planted as I envisioned a space that celebrated
                        the
                        art and the story of dance and provided a platform for exceptional talent. The planning phase
                        was
                        meticulous, with a focus on creating a unique and vibrant dance community.

                    <p>Countless hours were
                        dedicated to shaping the company's vision, from conceptualizing choreography styles to
                        assembling a
                        team of passionate instructors. The dream became a reality in the beginning of 2022, as The
                        Secret
                        Vault officially launched, bringing together a fusion of creativity, a beautiful story and
                        professionalism.

                    <p>Why is it called The Secret Vault? When I was younger, I used to view a dance studio as a
                        precious yet a secret space ONLY for dancers to come and express their feelings, once that door
                        was shut, it was you and the music! We are looking for those new gems ready to start shining! I
                        want new faces, new talent, and new ideas!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Everyone that comes to dance in the secret vault are
                        those beautiful gems, safe and encouraged to shine their own way! We understand that in this
                        generation is very difficult to walk into the dance industry and have your big break, that’s why
                        we we welcome everyone who wants to really start on their dance Journey!

                <p>Kabul, Afghanistan, A country that has so many different beautiful colours and stories, a powerful
                    culture that uses dancing as a way that shows unity and love for example the Attan, traditionally a
                    war dance to show GREAT FORCE now being used as a symbol of love, this showed me from a young age
                    the beauty of interpretation and appreciation! Which originally is what inspired me to dance, and
                    more importantly dance as a career!

                                            situations? I want to see that! True and pure empowerment! We want to push

                                            classes, that box does not exist! Show me the weird in weirdo! Let’s see

                                        where I did ballet and tap until age 15, where I started getting into K-pop.

                                            during uni, I met a bunch of hiphop dancers at a practice area and found it
                                            so cool that they had something different that I didn’t have and since then
                                            I dived way more into dance, getting addicted to learning the ins and outs,
                                            and pretty much started loving all the dance styles really!

                                    <p class="bio">I started my dance journey back in 2019, just taking classes for fun
                                        but then I realised very early on that I wanted to train to be a professional
                                        dancer. Since then, I have trained in styles of Commercial, Heels, Hip-Hop and
                                        Dancehall.</p>

                                            performed on stages. It’s not about getting the choreography right, it’s
                                            about enjoying and expressing yourself. If you come to any of my classes, I
                                            can offer you the basic foundations when dancing in heels and new
                                            moves/tricks to take to other classes or into your freestyles. Hope to see

                                            doesn’t always mean slow and sensual. It could also mean, Commercial in
                                            heels, Afro in heels or Hip-Hop in heels. I like to switch it up. My aim for
                                            my classes is to build your confidence through dance and how to work with
                                            the camera when being filmed.

                                        I have been dancing for 5 years now and it’s always been about self exploitation
                                        through dance. My main dance style has always been commerical and I’ve been
                                        inspired by artist like Beyoncé however I try to bring a fusion of styles that
                                        meld with the music to each class and hope to present dance that can make people
                                        feel good and enjoy whilst pushing their skills to the upmost! My main training
                                        purposes with every dance students is muscle memory, that’s why I push my
                                        choreography to be longer so we can help train our students to pick up
                                        choreography faster.

                                        commercial, hip-hop, street, afro and heels. My dance journey started in 2018 in
                                        Amsterdam, when I learned Kpop choreographies in my free time and went to dance
                                        classes almost 5 days a week. I moved to London in 2020 and have broadened my

                                            vibe and lyrics to portray a character through dance and always encourage
                                            everyone in my class to really commit to it. My classes will be different
                                            each time, you can expect: a feminine heels choreo with floor work, or a
                                            choreo to a badass song to get that inner bad b out, or a cute choreo where
                                            we explore our inner hello kitty.

                                    <p class="bio">Hi all, my name is Amelia, better known as Crimson, i teach styles
                                        including heels/acro-heels with a rock n roll twist. Through each choreography i
                                        create, i aim to embrace an intimidating sexy feel through powerful,sensual and
                                        striking moves that require a lot of bodily strength and persona. Pushing
                                        boundaries of every dancer that joins the secret vault, revealing a exciting and
                                        unique choreography each time. As the CEO says “we dance to express not
                                        impress”, and that is exactly what i venture to do.

                                            more in-tune with themselves and what they can push can do not only as a
                                            performer but person to. through combing the heels genre with my personal
                                            rockstar aesthetic i strive to create an atmosphere people haven’t

                                            an alternative version of themselves and deepens personal growth. i hope to
